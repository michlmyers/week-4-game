jQuery Assignment Game
WELCOME

This repo holds the jQuery guessing game I worked on for my Rutgers Bootcamp during late March of 2018.

This works as expected and contains multiple random number generators and hidden values attached to image buttons.


It's a useful project for me and likely any other student learning how to write Javascript and jQuery.

Pro users can probably move on unless they are curious. Students may find some usefullness in my layout or functions.

You can contant me for any questions. I am the sole contributor to this as it's my homework.
